### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was a first draft of a high/low guessing game, where player one chooses a secret number and player two guesses the number. In this lab I have learned to use the if statement.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because I have never played the Blackjack game. Thus, I was curious about how it works. Due to the lab, I was able to create a program for the game, using functions for the first time.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it was interesting to learn about different California counties and their population. I was able to use a 2D vector for the first time in order to organize California's population data by county.
